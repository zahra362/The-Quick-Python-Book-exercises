In this exercise, we experiment with Python variables including strings, integers, floats, and complex numbers. 
We explore operations between them and also use the `math` and `cmath` modules.


Additionally, we experiment with the `input()` function to get string, integer, and float input. 
We observe the effect of not using `int()` or `float()` when expecting numeric input, 
and explore what happens if the user deliberately enters the wrong type of value 
(e.g., a float when an integer is expected, or a string when a number is expected).

The last section demonstrates non-Pythonic variable names such as 'longvarname' and 'foobar', showing why variable names without underscores reduce readability and do not follow Python's preferred snake_case style.
